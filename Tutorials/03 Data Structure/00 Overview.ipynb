        "\n",
        "Welcome to the **Data Structures** section of this tutorial! This is where we dive into the backbone of programming: **storing and managing data**. From simple collections to more complex and structured types, you'll gain the tools to organize and manipulate information efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine trying to manage a library's catalog or a social media feed without a proper system to store, retrieve, and organize data. Data structures are what allow us to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems. With TypeScript, you also get the bonus of static typing, which catches errors early and makes your code more predictable.\n",

        "## Topics\n",
        "\n",
        "- **[Memory](01%20Memory.ipynb)**: Explore how variables and data are stored in memory, and understand key concepts like `null` and `undefined`.\n",
        "- **[Encoding](02%20Encoding.ipynb)**: Learn how TypeScript encodes different data types like numbers, strings, and booleans, and why this matters for performance and correctness.\n",
        "- **[Objects](03%20Objects.ipynb)**: Discover how to group related data and functionality using objects, the Swiss Army knife of JavaScript and TypeScript.\n",
        "- **[Classes](04%20Classes.ipynb)**: Move beyond objects to learn about classes, a blueprint for creating structured and reusable objects.\n",
        "- **[Generics](05%20Generics.ipynb)**: Unlock the power of reusable and type-safe code by learning how to work with generics in functions and classes.\n",
        "- **[Arrays](06%20Arrays.ipynb)**: Master one of the most versatile data structures for handling collections of values.\n",
        "- **[Tuples](07%20Tuples.ipynb)**: Learn how to work with fixed-size collections of typed values for compact and efficient data representation.\n",
        "- **[Sets](08%20Sets.ipynb)**: Explore unique collections that prevent duplicate values and offer efficient membership checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It All Fits Together\n",
        "\n",
        "This section is designed to progressively build your understanding of data structures while minimizing cognitive load. We start with foundational concepts like **memory** and **encoding**, giving you a sense of how TypeScript represents and interacts with data. Then, we move into **objects** and **classes**, where you'll learn how to structure and organize your data for clarity and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you're comfortable with these basics, we'll introduce **generics**, which allow you to write flexible and type-safe code. From there, we'll dive into specific data structures like **arrays**, **tuples**, and **sets**, exploring their unique strengths and practical applications. By the end of this section, you'll see how these concepts interconnect to form the building blocks of modern TypeScript programming.\n",
