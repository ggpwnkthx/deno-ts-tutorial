    "\n",
    "When you declare a variable in TypeScript, it is stored in your computer's memory. Each piece of memory has an **address**, like a house on a street, and a **pointer** is a way to reference this address. While you donâ€™t have to worry about managing memory directly in TypeScript, understanding this concept helps explain how variables and data interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you declare `const x = 5`. This value (`5`) is stored in memory at an address (e.g., `12`). When your code accesses `x`, it knows to use its pointer to look up the actual value at address `12`."
