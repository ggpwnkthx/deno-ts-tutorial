        "# Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "In the digital world, everything reduces down to binary data (bits of `0`s and `1`s). While this foundational layer is extremely precise and detailed, working directly at the binary level would be cumbersome and prone to errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "TypeScript, handles much of this complexity for you. It maps high-level language features (like `booleans`, `strings`, `numbers`, and `bigints`) down to efficient binary layouts. This ensures that your code remains readable and manageable, while the low-level details of memory allocation, byte alignment, and encoding formats remain largely hidden under the hood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let‚Äôs take a closer look at some common primitive types and their encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Boolean\n",
        "\n",
        "You write `true` or `false`. A straightforward yes/no value.\n",
        "```typescript\n",
        "const isActive: boolean = true;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Internally, a `boolean` is often represented in a single binary bit (0 or 1). However, alignment rules on modern hardware typically store a boolean as a full byte to work smoothly with memory and CPU instructions.\n",
        "```typescript\n",
        "false  ‚Üí 00000000\n",
        "true   ‚Üí 00000001\n",
        "```\n",
        "These small-but-important details (bit vs. byte, padding, and alignment) are handled automatically by TypeScript, ensuring that you can use `boolean` values as simple logical flags without ever worrying about their low-level binary representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Strings\n",
        "\n",
        "You write `\"Hi üåç\"` as a series of characters. That‚Äôs all you need to know - just text.\n",
        "\n",
        "```typescript\n",
        "const message: string = \"Hi üåç\";\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "TypeScript uses UTF-16 for string representation. Common characters (like English letters) take 2 bytes (16 bits).\n",
        "```typescript\n",
        "01001000 00000000   01101001 00000000   00100000 00000000\n",
        "        | H                 | i                 | (space)\n",
        "```\n",
        "Some characters, like emojis (üåç), require 4 bytes due to UTF-16 surrogate pairs.\n",
        "```typescript\n",
        "11011000 00101100 11011111 00101101\n",
        "        | High            | Low\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Inside the machine, each seemingly simple character could be multiple bytes of binary data. Yet, all you see is a regular string variable. TypeScript effortlessly manages these differences, allowing you to treat all characters equally, even though their binary footprint varies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "You write `123.456` and treat it as a single numeric value.\n",
        "\n",
        "```typescript\n",
        "const value: number = 123.456;\n",

        "This design allows a huge range of values but cannot represent all decimal numbers exactly, sometimes causing tiny rounding errors. While you perform simple math, TypeScript handles these intricate binary patterns and the subtle pitfalls of floating-point arithmetic behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## BigInt\n",
        "\n",
        "`bigint` is just an integer type without size limits. Use it to store arbitrarily large whole numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "```typescript\n",
        "const huge = 987654321987654321n\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "A `bigint` doesn‚Äôt fit into a neat, fixed-size box like a `number`. Instead, it starts with a sign bit to indicate positive or negative. This is followed by a size field (often 4 bytes) to indicate how many chunks of data will follow. And then finally, a the magnitude (the absolute value) made of 8-byte chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "```typescript\n",
        "Sign: 0 (positive)\n",

        "  ... and so on\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Each arithmetic operation on `bigint` involves managing these 8-byte segments, carrying over as needed for addition or multiplication, and allocating more chunks if the number grows even larger. While this process is more complex and potentially slower than dealing with fixed-size number values, it ensures that you never lose precision due to overflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "TypeScript shields you from this complexity, letting you write straightforward code even when handling astronomically large integers.\n",

        "# Why Encoding Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding these encodings, even at a high level, provides two key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Performance Insight: When dealing with extremely large integers, strings containing diverse characters, or performance-critical numeric calculations, knowing what‚Äôs happening under the hood can guide you to more efficient code.\n",
        "- Predictability in Interactions: When your code interacts with binary protocols, reads or writes files, or interfaces with lower-level languages, this knowledge helps you anticipate data transformations and avoid subtle bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, TypeScript handles a labyrinth of binary complexity, so you don‚Äôt have to. But a bit of understanding can help you navigate performance trade-offs and system boundaries more effectively."
