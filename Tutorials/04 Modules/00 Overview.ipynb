    "\n",
    "Modules are a way to structure your code into reusable units. By breaking your code into smaller modules, you can:\n",
    "- Keep your codebase organized and manageable.\n",
    "- Share functionality across different parts of your application.\n",
    "- Avoid name conflicts by encapsulating code in its own scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Deno, a **module** is any file that contains code. Each `.ts` file is treated as an independent module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deno relies on **URL-based imports**, meaning you reference modules using file paths or remote URLs.\n",
