        "\n",
        "Welcome to the **Modules** section! In this part of the tutorial, you'll explore how to structure, organize, and share your TypeScript code effectively. Modular programming is a key concept for building scalable and maintainable applications. By dividing your code into smaller, reusable pieces, you can simplify development and improve code readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "With TypeScript and Deno, you get robust support for modules and namespaces. You'll learn how to create and use modules, leverage namespaces for organizing related functionality, and take advantage of the built-in `Deno` namespace for powerful features like file system access, permissions, and runtime utilities. Additionally, we'll dive into the `console` object, a crucial tool for debugging and logging.\n",

        "## Topics\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **[Exporting](01%20Exporting.ipynb)**: Learn how to share code between files using `export` statements.\n",
        "2. **[Importing](02%20Importing.ipynb)**: Discover how to bring in shared code from other files with `import` statements.\n",
        "3. **[Namespaces](03%20Namespaces.ipynb)**: Organize your code into logical groups using namespaces.\n",
        "4. **[`Deno`](04%20Deno.ipynb)**: Utilize the `Deno` namespace for secure and feature-rich runtime operations.\n",
        "5. **[`console`](05%20Console.ipynb)**: Utilize the `console` object for logging and debugging in your applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It All Fits Together\n",
        "\n",
        "This section is designed to help you understand and implement modular programming principles. We'll start by covering the basics of **exporting** and **importing**, which are the building blocks of code modularization. You'll see how to use these concepts to break your code into manageable pieces and share functionality between files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we'll dive into **namespaces**, which allow you to organize your code into logical groups without polluting the global scope. Namespaces are particularly useful for managing larger codebases with interdependent components.\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, we’ll explore the **`Deno`** namespace, a powerful part of the Deno runtime. You'll learn how to leverage this namespace for operations like reading and writing files, managing environment variables, and working with permissions. The `Deno` namespace simplifies many common development tasks while maintaining security and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we'll look at **`console`**, a built-in object that provides methods for logging, debugging, and interacting with your application during development. From basic logging to advanced debugging techniques, you'll see how `console` can be an invaluable tool in your TypeScript toolkit.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this section, you'll have a strong understanding of how to use modules and namespaces to organize your code effectively, leverage the Deno runtime for secure operations, and debug your applications with ease. Let’s get started!\n"
