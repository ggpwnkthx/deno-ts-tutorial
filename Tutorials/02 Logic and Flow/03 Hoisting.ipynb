        "We can use the `function` keyword followed by a name to create a reusable reference (similar to a variable). Due to a runtime concept called **hoisting**, it's important to make a distinction between named function statements and variable declaration statements (where the variable's value is assigned to an anonymous function).\n",

        "Hoisting refers to how the TypeScript runtime processes code before execution. It's like the way a teacher might organize a classroom before a lesson starts. Imagine you have notes scattered throughout your notebook, but before the class begins, the teacher arranges all the important definitions and declarations at the front so everyone knows they're there.\n",

Choose the function style that best suits the readability and maintainability needs of your codebase, being mindful of hoisting behavior."
